# Evaluator Reimplemented in C as a module
The main goal of this project was twofold, both give myself a reason to properly learn C and optimize the evaluator.
The reason I chose C as the programming language is because I like low-level programming, it can help optimize the part of the interpreter that cares the most about performance, and there's official resources for creating Python modules in C.

Link to the documentation I consulted: [https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html]
